Introduction
=============

This directory contains Device Tree overlays. Device Tree makes it possible
to support many hardware configurations with a single kernel and without the
need to explicitly load or blacklisr kernel modules.

On Rock Pi S, you will find a .dtb for each base platform in /boot. This
describes the hardware that is part of the Rock Pi S board. The loader selects
the .dtb file appropriate for the platform by name and pass it to the kernel.

Device Tree Overlays usage is controlled from /boot/hw_intfc.conf. You can do
the settings for Rock Pi S in your hw_intfc.conf, which should cause your
Rock Pi S to do your wanted things after a reboot.

In /boot/overlays you will find many .dtbo files. The loader will merge the
selected .dtbo files by reading file /boot/hw_intfc.conf.


Using Overlays
===============

Overlays are loaded using "intfc:" directive. Take disable-console as an example.
Add one line in hw_intfc.conf:

	intfc:dtoverlay=console-on-ttyS2

This causes the file /boot/overlays/disable-console.dtbo to be loaded.

N.B. It is recommended to only ebable those bus interfaces that are needed.
Leaving all interfaces enabled can lead to unwanted behaviour.


Name:   console-on-ttyS0.dtbo
